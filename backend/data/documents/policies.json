    "title": "Warranty and Support Policy",
    "content": "All TechPro products include a manufacturer warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. Standard warranty is 1 year from purchase date, with premium products including extended coverage (2-3 years). Warranty covers hardware failures including display defects, battery issues, charging problems, and component failures. Software issues are typically resolved through updates and are not warranty claims. Warranty does NOT cover physical damage, liquid damage, unauthorized repairs, cosmetic wear, or normal battery degradation. To claim warranty service, contact support with proof of purchase and description of issue. Diagnostic steps may be required. Approved claims receive repair or replacement at our discretion. Advance replacement is available for select products - replacement ships before you return defective unit (hold on credit card). Returned products must include all original accessories. Turnaround time for warranty repairs is typically 5-10 business days. Extended warranty plans are available at purchase covering accidental damage and extending coverage period. Refurbished products carry 90-day warranty. Warranty is void if serial number is removed or altered.",
