    "question": "What warranty do your products have?",
    "answer": "All TechPro products include a manufacturer warranty. Most products have a 1-year standard warranty, with premium items like the X2 Laptop including 2-3 year coverage. Warranties cover manufacturing defects and hardware failures under normal use. Accidental damage, water damage, and unauthorized modifications void the warranty. Extended warranty protection plans are available at purchase providing additional coverage for accidental damage and extending the warranty period. Warranty service can be initiated through our support portal. We offer advance replacement for many products, sending a replacement before you return the defective unit. Warranty is non-transferable and applies to original purchaser only.",
